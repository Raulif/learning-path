## Implementation Strategy

### **Monthly Focus Approach**
- **Months 1-2**: Focus on 2 topics simultaneously
- **Months 3-4**: Continue with 2 topics, start introducing the 3rd
- **Months 5-6**: Rotate focus to ensure all areas receive attention
- **Months 7-12**: Deep dive into practical applications and projects
- **Year 2**: Advanced mastery and real-world application

### **Weekly Time Allocation**
- **2-3 hours**: Primary learning (tutorials, courses, reading)
- **2-3 hours**: Hands-on practice and projects
- **1 hour**: Community engagement and networking
- **1 hour**: Documentation and reflection

### **Progress Tracking**
- Monthly self-assessment against curriculum goals
- Quarterly practical projects to demonstrate learning
- Bi-annual review and curriculum adjustment
- Annual portfolio update and job market evaluation

### **Success Metrics**
- Completed practical projects for each topic
- Contributions to open source or community
- Improved performance in current role
- Increased job opportunities and compensation offers
- Recognition as technical expert in chosen areas
